<h1>Server side project in nodeJS</h1>

In this project, I developed server-side code in Node.js for a system that coordinates between volunteers and help seekers.
The system includes three main screens: 
a list of open help requests with filtering options by location, status, and priority; 
detailed view of a specific help request; 
and a volunteer screen for existing and new volunteers, including updating request status and registering new volunteers. 
Data is stored in MongoDB. 
The project follows REST principles, with a layered architecture: a DB layer for data retrieval, a business logic layer for data processing, and an API layer for client interaction.
